# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is intended to use images of different vegetables and based on that, build a model to categorize new images with the correct amount and type of fruit or vegetable. The model that will be used is a CNN. 


## Background

The solution does not solve a pervasive problem in and of itself, rather it is the first step toward a smart kitchen. This also seems like a small enough step for me to learn enough Python to build and try to ship a deep learning model.


## How is it used?

The users are shoppers who recently have returned from the supermarket or just have taken possession of their foodstuff from the delivery person, and they are about to store it in their kitchen. For example, they can then put 3 bananas under the installed kitchen camera and it will register that 3 bananas has been added.


## Data sources and AI methods
I plan to collect most of the data myself through taking the initial photos and labelling them to understand the process and get a working prototype. If I succeed in a small way, I will source more photos and have them labeled through mechanical turk or a similar service.


## Challenges

I must comply with the GBPR (General Banana Protection Regulation), but aside from that, I think I can sidestep most ethical issues. To be honest, this project is not a world-changing idea so if I ever get it to "production" I will come back and think about this once more.

## What next?

I need to further my skills in Python programming and I have enrolled in a new course for that. I am also planning on finally finishing Andrew Ngs ML courses on Coursera.


## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Reaktor, University of Helsinki and everyone else who have been a part in making both Elements of AI and Building AI a reality.
